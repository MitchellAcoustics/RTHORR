# RTHORR

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RTHORR is to make it simple to run a text file of
correlation matrices through the randomization test of hypothesized
order relations (RTHOR; Hubert & Arabie, 1987) and make comparisons of
fit between pairs of matrices. This program is especially valuable in
the evaluation of circumplex models of data as found in color
perception, vocational interests, and interpersonal behavior.

## Installation

You can install this development version of RTHORR from
[github](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("michaellynnmorris/RTHORR")
```

## Examples

``` r
library(RTHORR)

#run randall on input.txt
#outputs a single data frame with RTHOR results
randall_output <- RTHORR::randall(n=6,
                                  nmat=3,
                                  input=system.file("extdata", "input.txt", package = "RTHORR"),
                                  samp = c("sample_one", "sample_two", "sample_three"))


#run randmf on input.txt
#outputs a list with two dataframes (RTHOR results and comparisons)
randmf_output <- RTHORR::randmf(n=6,
                                nmat=3,
                                input=system.file("extdata", "input.txt", package = "RTHORR"))


#view an example of correlation matrix input
file.edit(system.file("extdata", "input.txt", package = "RTHORR"))
```
